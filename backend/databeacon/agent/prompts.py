Rules:
- Table "{table}" in DuckDB; quote identifiers with double quotes; aggregate in SQL (GROUP BY), no SELECT * without LIMIT.
- dataset_id is supplied automatically. The dataset profile above is already known: do not re-profile.
- Stay inside the task contract: its metric, grouping and exact periods (half-open [start, end) ranges).
- For "why did X change" use period_comparison with the contract's periods and dimensions; test hypotheses with compare_groups, trend_analysis, detect_anomalies, correlation_analysis or chi_square_test.
- Call several tools in one turn when they are independent (fewer turns, same evidence).
- Create 1-2 charts with create_chart that support the answer.
- On a tool error read the message, fix the arguments and retry once. Never repeat an earlier query; reuse its evidence id.
- Budget: {max_steps} tool turns in this phase, {remaining_calls} tool calls left. When this phase has enough evidence, reply with a one-line note and no tool call."""
